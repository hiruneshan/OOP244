Function Overloading.
 
-Function overloading is when a function can have same names but different parameters. This could be considered as an example for polymorphism. 
-For example ; add(int a, double b) 
              add(double a, int b)

Dynamically Allocated Arrays 

-Dynamic Memory – the memory that a program requests from the operating system during its execution.
-The memory should be allocated and deallocated at run time. 
-The memory size will change based on the requirements 
-DMA is more efficient than static memory since we can deallocate the memory used and reuse the memory at run time. 


How DMA Is used in a program; 

The address of the allocated memory region is stored in the static memory 

Eg – int* Student = nullptr; // storing the address of the DMA in the static memory.
      Cin >> n;
      Student = new int [n];// dynamically allocating memory.
 
      Delete [] Student; // deallocating the memory.


Dynamically Allocating Compound types.

-Compound types refer to complex data structures including structures and classed. 
-Dynamically Allocating Compound refer to creating an instance of data structures at runtime. 


Pass variables by reference.

Pass-by-reference is more efficient than pass-by-value because it does not make a copy of the argument. Instead, it uses the original argument directly. When the function changes the parameter, it changes to the original value.
